*^ My given name. Yes, both words! Ain't the world interesting.*

I am a writer, artist, and researcher. My practice focuses on tangible lived experience as a conduit for truth, looking in particular to documentation
and reflection as tools of discovery.

In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
