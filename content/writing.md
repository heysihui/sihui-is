Under construction. Flashes in time.\
Some poetry, for now:

✨

# Dusk

You ask me\
how the world is meant to be\
and how it is we are told\
we should live.

I suppose I am afraid of\
what my life is\
and what it\
could be.

✨

# Period

Class monitor lizard walks the\
expansive sky, remembers the slant\
of the school roof, recollects\
tails pinafores cannot hide.

Time doesn’t stop the way we planned.\
It only puts its back to the wall,\
politely flattens itself to let us pass,\
and spends the rest of summer\
chasing us down other hallowed halls.

There isn’t much left to the lesson\
There — the bell’s gone again.
