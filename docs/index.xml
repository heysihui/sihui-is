      <description>Writer, artist, and researcher. Left-handed tapir child, online since 1999 and a general curmudgeon since birth. My secret life goal is to be in a crossword puzzle.
Currently: Design researcher, writer and artist-in-residence.
I&amp;rsquo;m happiest telling stories, helping human beings understand other human beings, and making things work, no matter how scrappy or small. I care about: Intentionality, emotions and experiences, doing good in the world and doing it well. I believe the best writing reads like a conversation you never want to end.</description>

      <description>v1.0 | Aug 2020 Running this site off Hugo on the Call me Sam theme and trying my darndest best to learn How To Do Front End. Have come a long way from coding blogskins in my preteen years and I am so much more easily confused by the file structures these days, despite the relative ease of Markdown and Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;ve taken about a month of on-and-off tinkering to put this together.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Attention is the beginning of devotion.&amp;rdquo; ‚Äî Mary Oliver
In 2012, Robin Sloan published a tap essay-app called Fish. It extolled the value of, in the age of a fast-moving internet, returning to the things you love over and over again. Looking at your fish.
In its spirit, here are the fish in my genealogy of influence.

      <description>Experiments, experiences, performance. My practice focuses on the documentation of and reflection on tangible lived experience. More and more I am attracted to the idea of time, open-ended processes, and a personal understanding. Most recently, I am in residence with Centre 42‚Äôs The Vault Lite.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a design researcher for civic tech, with vested interest in product strategy and past experience in service design.
This is a work in progress and my way of working with the garage door up, although that is a plainly suburban car-driving American-leaning term; I‚Äôve never had to interact with a garage door in my life.
