      <description>Under construction. Flashes in time.
Some poetry, for now:
‚ú®
Dusk You ask me
how the world is meant to be
and how it is we are told
we should live.
I suppose I am afraid of
what my life is
and what it
could be.
‚ú®
Period Class monitor lizard walks the
expansive sky, remembers the slant
of the school roof, recollects
tails pinafores cannot hide.
Time doesn‚Äôt stop the way we planned.</description>

      <description>v1.0 | Aug 2020 Running this site off Hugo on the Call me Sam theme and trying my darndest best to learn How To Do Front End. Have come a long way from coding blogskins in my preteen years and I am so much more easily confused by the file structures these days, despite the relative ease of Markdown and Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;ve taken about a month of on-and-off tinkering to put this together.</description>

      <description>In 2012, Robin Sloan published a tap essay-app called Fish. It extolled the value of, in the age of a fast-moving internet, returning to the things you love over and over again. Looking at your fish.
In its spirit, here are the fish in my genealogy of influence:

      <description>[My given name. Yes, both words.]
Writer, designer, homesick for the sublime.
In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
