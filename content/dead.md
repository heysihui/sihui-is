The Funeral
Organised by Liz
Books for people to take home (after family, closest friends, lovers present and former)
Printer on-site for people to print out photographs and write down memories -- a photo wall that converts into book for keeping
Music
Lots of flowers, not wreaths
Nice snacks? -- I'm already dead, let my people eat cake

The Cremation
None of that walking barefoot on the road nonsense please
My ashes go into the sea

The Anniversary
A chill evening gathering
Open mic and poetry night
