Because I am bossy, and sentimental, and simply Too Much.

# The Funeral

1. I haven't decided about the open casket, but I'd like to be cremated in a cardboard box that can be decorated and written on.
1. Play all the sad soppy stuff I love best: Frank Ocean, Sufjan Stevens, Kelsey Lu, Phoebe Bridgers, Andrew Bird, Rachel Yamagata, Cigarettes After Sex, FKA twigs, Damien Rice, The Velvet Underground, slow Mandopop.
1. After my family, closest friends, and lovers former and present have taken their pick, lay my books out for people to bring home. They are the closest thing I have to a soul.
1. Bring flowers, lots of them; give them to everyone else I love. Life is short and brutish but we still have each other.
1. Wine, and some sort of dessert bar. I'm already dead, let my people eat cake.

# The Cremation

1. None of that walking barefoot on the road nonsense, please. Asphalt in Singapore is very hot.
1. Play the raging music of my teenage years: Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance,  Linkin Park, Something Corporate; blast it as loud as possible when I enter the furnace.
1. My ashes are to go into the sea. If the weather's any good, try to enjoy the sea breeze after. It does wonders for the soul.

# The Anniversary

1. Hold an open mic night, a chill evening gathering by the sea, wherever you may be. Bring wine, and poetry or prose to be read aloud.
1. Play some wordless wonders: Olafur Arnalds, Max Richter, Philip Glass, Vivaldi, Ennio Morricone, Joe Hisaishi.
1. Hold each other close. If you love someone, tell them.
