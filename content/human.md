Person in Tech by day, writer and artist by night, improviser by the weekend; left-handed curmudgeon all day every day.

I'm happiest telling stories and making things work, no matter how scrappy or small. I care about: Intentionality, emotions and experiences, doing good in the world and doing it well.

In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
