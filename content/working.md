I'm a [design researcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/si-hui/) with vested interest in product strategy and service design. I love working with nimble, passionate teams to sensemake, storytell, and speak truth to power.

My experiences across the private and public sector include:

- Leading research to build digital identity products for 2.5 million users
- Setting up a Wizard-of-Oz style co-creation lab for elevator experiences in Shanghai
- Prototyping and testing with everything from interactive media to physical spaces
- Exploring the future of learning experiences and relationships in classrooms
- Creating research principles and processes to lead a design team
- Facilitating workshops and teams of 30+ in alignment and cocreation

My work revolves around the strategy and innovation space, so most of it is not publicly sharable. To find out more, please [get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/si-hui/).
