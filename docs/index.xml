      <description>Lim (family name) Si Hui (given name, yes, both words)
Person in Tech by day, writer and artist by night, improviser by the weekend.
I&amp;rsquo;m happiest telling stories and making things work, no matter how scrappy or small. I care very much about intentionality, emotions, experiences, doing good in the world and doing it well.
In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.</description>

      <description>v1.0 | Aug 2020 Running this site off Hugo on the Call me Sam theme and trying my darndest best to learn How To Do Front End. Have come a long way from coding blogskins in my preteen years and I am so much more easily confused by the file structures these days, despite the relative ease of Markdown and Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;ve taken about a month of on-and-off tinkering to put this together.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Attention is the beginning of devotion.&amp;rdquo; ‚Äî Mary Oliver
In 2012, Robin Sloan published a tap essay-app called Fish. It extolled the value of, in the age of a fast-moving internet, returning to the things you love over and over again. Looking at your fish.
In its spirit, here are the fish in my genealogy of influence.

      <description>My creative practice thrives on documentation, reflection, and tangible lived experience. More and more, I am experimenting with the idea of reaching an understanding of the self through repetition and time-bound rituals.
