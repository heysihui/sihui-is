~~My creative practice thrives on documentation, reflection, and lived experience. More and more, I am experimenting with the idea of reaching an understanding of the self through repetition and time-bound rituals.~~ I make helpful things [at work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/si-hui/) and thoughtful, joyful things for myself.
