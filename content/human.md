Writer, artist, improviser, left-handed curmudgeon. My secret life goal is to be in a crossword puzzle.

I'm happiest telling stories, helping human beings understand other human beings, and making things work, no matter how scrappy or small.

I care about: Intentionality, emotions and experiences, doing good in the world and doing it well.

I believe the best writing reads like a conversation you never want to end.

In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
