_**Lim** (family name) **Si Hui** (given name, yes, both words)_

Writer, experience designer, improviser. Currently obsessed with a text/ural practice: sound, light, touch, and rhythm.

I'm happiest telling stories and making things work, no matter how scrappy or small. I care very much about intentionality, interiorities, doing good in the world and doing it well.  

In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
