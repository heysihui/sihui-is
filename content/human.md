_**Lim** (family name) **Si Hui** (given name, yes, both words)_

[Designer]({{< ref "/working" >}}) by day, [writer]({{< ref "/writing" >}}) and [gremlin]({{< ref "/making" >}}) by night, improviser by the weekend.

I'm happiest telling stories and making things work, no matter how scrappy or small. I care very much about intentionality, emotions, experiences, doing good in the world and doing it well.

In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
