*My given name is Si Hui. Yes, both words! Ain't the world grand.*

Writer, artist, and researcher. Left-handed tapir child. My practice focuses on the documentation of and reflection on tangible lived experience. Most recently in residence with Centre 42's The Vault Lite.

In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
