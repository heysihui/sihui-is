what my life is
and what it
could be.

      <description>In 2012, Robin Sloan published a tap essay-app called Fish. It extolled the value of, in the age of a fast-moving internet, returning to the things you love over and over again. Looking at your fish.
In its spirit, here are the fish in my genealogy of influence:

      <description>[My given name. Yes, both words.]
Writer, designer, homesick for the sublime.
In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
