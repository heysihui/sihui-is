Writer, artist, and researcher. Left-handed tapir child, online since 1999 and a general curmudgeon since birth. My secret life goal is to be in a crossword puzzle.

**Currently:** [Design researcher](working), writer and [artist-in-residence](https://centre42.sg/the-vault-lite-open-call/).

I'm happiest telling stories, helping human beings understand other human beings, and making things work, no matter how scrappy or small. I care about: Intentionality, emotions and experiences, doing good in the world and doing it well. I believe the best writing reads like a conversation you never want to end.

In the matter of living, I am concerned with the widening of the human heart.
