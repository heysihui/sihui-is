# v1.0 | Aug 2020

Running this site off Hugo on the [Call me Sam](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/) theme and trying my darndest best to learn How To Do Front End. Have come a long way from coding blogskins in my preteen years and I am so much more easily confused by the file structures these days, despite the relative ease of Markdown and Hugo.

I've taken about a month of on-and-off tinkering to put this together. Figured out how to hide links, set up structures, edit SASS files. There's a lot I still don't know! I couldn't write a Hugo template from scratch and I think I should learn eventually. I'd like to update the illustrations gallery and eventually host more complex projects.

The only really complete page at the moment is [Looking]({{< ref "/looking" >}}), which mainly links to work I very much love. And that is okay! The learning is in the doing. I spent five hours learning to push to Git and resolving deployment and domain issues, which is five more hours than I ever have.
