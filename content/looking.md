In 2012, [Robin Sloan](https://robinsloan.com) published a tap essay-app called [Fish](https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/). It extolled the value of, in the age of a fast-moving internet, returning to the things you love over and over again. Looking at your fish.

In its spirit, here are the fish in my genealogy of influence:

🚀

Designers, researchers, Tech-Adjacent Folks on Twitter who led me to my career and life: [Adrianna Tan](https://popagandhi.com/), [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/), [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/), [Tricia Wang](https://www.triciawang.com/), [Jan Chipchase](https://janchipchase.com/), [Nicolas Nova](http://nearfuturelaboratory.com/).

If you take craft far enough it can seem like magic: The work of [Automato](http://automato.farm). [Kelli Anderson](https://vimeo.com/332596348)'s motion and paper craft. [Nicole He](http://nicole.pizza/)'s weird stuff. [Molleindustria](https://www.molleindustria.org/)'s work, especially this 8-bit museum [LikeLike](https://likelike.glitch.me/?room=likelikeOutside).

I saw [Egon Schiele](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/seated-male-nude-self-portrait-egon-schiele/2QEjbgnQo_ZsVQ?hl=en)'s work in Leopold Museum one cold dark winter's night and the world opened right up. I visited the [Setouchi Islands](https://setouchi-artfest.jp/en/about/place.html) in the off-season and the universe came in through an open window. I went to college and the best thing I learnt about was [Goya](https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/saturn-devouring-his-son-1823-1#:~:text=Saturn%20Devouring%20His%20Son%20is,each%20one%20upon%20their%20birth.). To look, to look again.

🎭

I love Singaporean theatre: [Teater Ekamatra](https://ekamatra.org.sg/), who staged an amazing transcreation of A Clockwork Orange. [Grandmother Tongue](https://www.wildrice.com.sg/event/7122-grandmother-tongue-2/) by Thomas Lim; [GRC](https://centre42.sg/grc-geng-rebut-cabinet-by-teater-ekamatra/) by Alfian Saat.

Elsewhere, Punchdrunk's [The Drowned Man](http://www.punchdrunk.org.uk/project/the-drowned-man/) opened my eyes to a whole new world of possibilities and I haven't shut up about it for five years. [Hamilton](https://www.broadway.com/shows/hamilton-broadway/)'s ambition, [Hedwig & the Angry Inch](http://hedwigbroadway.com/)'s audacity — [Lena Hall](https://www.playbill.com/video/lena-halls-unbelievable-and-tony-winning-transformation)'s voice.

The words of the marvellous [Adrienne Rich](https://lithub.com/life-advice-from-adrienne-rich/):

> "An honorable human relationship—that is, one in which two people have the right to use the word “love”—is a process, delicate, violent, often terrifying to both persons involved, a process of refining the truths they can tell each other.
>
>It is important to do this because it breaks down human self-delusion and isolation.
>
> It is important to do this because in doing so we do justice to our own complexity.
>
> It is important to do this because we can count on so few people to go that hard way with us."
